In the present data-driven world, knowing the factors which impact pay is vital, particularly
in high-demand disciplines such as data science. This coursework examines wage data for
data scientists, with the goal of identifying trends and findings that can be utilized to assist in
decision-making processes. This investigation aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge
about the elements that influence wage levels in the data science sector by examining
numerous factors such as experience, job title, and work level.
This course guides us through the stages of data interpretation, preparation, exploration, and
early analysis using Python programming and data analysis methodologies. The foundation
for in-depth analysis is created by thoroughly evaluating the dataset, deleting extraneous
information, dealing with missing values, recognizing duplicates, and studying unique values.
The ultimate purpose of this course is to provide data scientists and stakeholders with
practical knowledge from the data. This analysis seeks to uncover trends and patterns in the
dataset by conducting detailed data analysis, summarizing statistics, computing correlations,
and presenting key findings using graphs and plots. Furthermore, the technical report that
accompanies the Python scripts has a full explanation of the methodology used, the results
achieved, and the explanation of findings.
This coursework serves as an essential component in the larger investigation of
compensation factors in the data science area. Through thorough data analysis and systematic
reporting, it seeks to bring insight into the complex relationship between many factors and
compensation levels, providing significant insights for industry, those making decisions and
stakeholders.
